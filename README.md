# bioinfo_fr_report_group_A
Report of group A for the bioinformatics course 2022 (FR)

Hello guys,
so I tried to set up the directory for the report.
I thought it might be the easiest if we write two individual reports for each project and then fuse them together at the end...
Everything concerning the formating and stuff: Maybe we have to change the margins etc, depending on how much space we need (since we only have a page limit). 
Not sure how it will work with the bibtex file...I always used Mendeley for bibliography but I think it will be alright since we won't have a ton of citations.
Really hope everything works...fingers crossed :)
Cheers,
Lea
