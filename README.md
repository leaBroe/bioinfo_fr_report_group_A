Report of group A for the bioinformatics course 2022 (FR) <br>

Hello guys, <br>
so I tried to set up the directory for the report. <br>
I thought it might be the easiest if we write two individual reports for each project and then fuse them together at the end...<br>
Everything concerning the formating and stuff: Maybe we have to change the margins etc, depending on how much space we need (since we have a page limit). <br> 
Not sure how it will work with the bibtex file...I always used Mendeley for bibliography and I have no clue how that works with github but I think it will be alright since we won't have a ton of citations. <br>
Really hope everything works...if not let me know! <br>
Cheers, <br>
Lea <br>
